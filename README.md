# tramTRACKER-Timer
A free mobile app timer for tramTRACKER using the existing PTV API. 
User can choose trams or routes which when set to say 3 minutes, will ring a timer when a tram is 3 minutes away (user chooses the time).

I do not earn any money from this or own any rights. All this product does is add a timer functionality to tramTRACKER.
The tramTRACKER PIDS Web Service is a service provided by Yarra Trams.
